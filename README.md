# NASA-Meteor-Report
This project is a twitter bot built using the tweepy library to interface with the Twitter API. The python bot operates the Twitter handle @meteorreport and automates posts about NEOs that NASA observed in the past 24 hours. The account is entirely automated and run by the bot. Information is access via the NASA NEO API which provides a publicly availible dataset regarding NEOs observed by NASA laboratories.
